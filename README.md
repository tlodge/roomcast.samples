#Buttokit samples

This repo has a bunch of scripts with some test data (for developments and node red)

To use it, if using standard mapped volumes (/opt), then you can just run ./copy.sh in the sample dir of your choice and it'll put the files where they need to be and restart the docker containers as required.  Magic.
